2. UX Foundations:
- Hierarchy: Use font size, color, and positioning to lead users through tasks.
- Consistency: Maintain a coherent style—fonts, spacing, colors—across screens.

3. Building Layouts with HTML/CSS:
- Begin with semantic markup (<header>, <section>, <footer>) before styling.
- Sketch wireframes first to plan structure and flow.
- Use CSS grids or flexboxes to organize content. Add padding and margins for clarity and balance.

4. Adding Transitions for Polished Interaction:
- Smooth button hover effects, fade-ins/fade-outs, slide-ins to enhance the user experience.
- Transitions help indicate state changes, make load times feel faster, and guide attention.
